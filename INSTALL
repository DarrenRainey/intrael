==INSTALL==
=== Requirements ===

- libfreenect > 1.1 (All platforms) http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started
   *1.1 is not suitable. As of this writing you'll need the unstable branch. 
- libjpeg or, preferably, libjpeg-turbo http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org
- Cmake >= 2.6 (All platforms) http://www.cmake.org

=== Basic Compiling Instructions ===

To use CMake:

- Make a directory somewhere, like 'build' in your repo directory.
- Go into that directory
- Type cmake ..
- Run make

If you have an SSE2(Intel) or NEON(Arm) enabled cpu you should set the option COMPILE_SSE2
or COMPILE_NEON to ON in the CMakeLists.txt file on the project root dir. They help alot.

=== Windows platform specifics ===

Follow the same instructions that are provided by libfreenect on the link above.
The usb drivers provided by libfreenect are also included in intrael binary dists.

===== Driver installation(Skip if already done while installing libfreenect) =====

Plug in your Kinect. Windows will warn that no device driver was found for the plugged device (the LED of Kinect will not turn on). If Windows presents a dialog asking to search for drivers, simply cancel it.

Open the Device Manager: Start >> Control Panel >> System and Security >> System >> Device Manager

A device called "Xbox NUI Motor" should be somewhere there (most probably be under "Other devices") with a small yellow warning symbol "!" on top of its icon. 

Right click on it, and select "Update Driver Software...", then click on "Browse my computer for driver software".

"Browse" and select the folder where the "XBox_NUI_Motor.inf" is located (/drivers inside the bundle containing intrael). 

Click "Next" and if warned by Windows that a non-certified driver is about to be installed, just order it to install it anyway.

After that, the Kinect LED should start blinking green. Now there will be two additional devices in the Device Manager list: "Xbox NUI Camera" and "Xbox NUI Audio". 

Repeat the above instructions for them as well.


=== Linux platform specifics ===

To run intrael as non-root, copy the file 51-kinect.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/
