=== 1.1 ===

	New features:
		- Server Sent Events for the JSON output. Enable it through the -m option.
		- Command line option (-t) that enables serving a single static html file.
		  This is useful as SSE(See above) doesn't support CORS on any browser yet.
	
	Fixes:
		- An issue with some defines when building for arm NEON instruction set.
		- The -e option would go as low as -1. Moved the lower bound to -1054.
		- The compilation process tried to statically link. Changed to dynamic.
		- The origins and IP whitelist files can be of arbitrary lengths now.
